## Summary

This week, I was able to follow and complete the week's homework, however I haven't solved the issue with hardcode credentinal on docker compose for postgres database. For homework challenges, I finished 6/8 challenges expect the challenges for running outside Gitpod and on EC2. For the challenges on multi-stage build and best pratice for docker file, there are a lot of space to improve, since my handons exprience is not enough. 

## Homework

#### Containerize Backend and Frontend Application
- [backend docker file](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile)
- [frontend docker file](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile)

#### Document the OpenAPI definition
- Commits [ae07e6f](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/ae07e6fec09323d875d6188fb2cc744afa9f42a7) ; [922b5b6](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/922b5b63c32b4a9fb784aea705a6fcdfa50b4757) 

#### Write the backend and frontend code to add notification functionality
- Commits [ae07e6f](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/ae07e6fec09323d875d6188fb2cc744afa9f42a7) ; [922b5b6](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/922b5b63c32b4a9fb784aea705a6fcdfa50b4757)

#### DB part - DynamoDB and Postgres
Postgres DB was connected via two methods by extension and and via CLI

## Homework Challenges

#### Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
- Commit [1d26acf](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/1d26acf5fef57905e8c1aa231279abbe89ad3284)

#### Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
[Container Image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/lhviet204/crud-backend-flask/1.0/images/sha256-092e191c0c80c9d815ae8920b759cde6ff1001762d03ed76884b01d1b36f05ff?tab=layers)

Image was pushed successfully on Docker Hub

#### Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build
- Commit [6628ab2](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/6628ab240d0e68d545123cdf3ef5f9edf97e6802)

#### Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
- Commit [3ee9ef0](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/3ee9ef0d50dfaa602f809858e5533be13e04c4a4)

Health check was implemented on backend docker file without checking the required 'curl' package. Here the status of container when health check was failed![failed healthcheck](assets/week1/failed_heatthcheck_status_docker_command.png)

After debug via container log, the root cause is missing the library, fixing via this commit [21e0dfb](https://github.com/lhviet204/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/21e0dfbf84e39fe4561fabfbbe3b74d3f0c07c72)

#### Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile
After I did the research on how to write the docker file, I decided to apply some practices: i.e. use multi-stage build, don't install unnecessary packages, Sort multi-line arguments.

## Try Harder
Challenges I couldn't get them done.
- Get the container running out of the GitPod, I accidently upgraded the current version of Docker Desktop, I will find the storage for upgrading on my laptop. (silly)[assets/week1/silly_things.png]
- Running the containers on EC2 free tier.
