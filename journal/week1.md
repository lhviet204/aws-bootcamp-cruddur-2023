## Summary

This week, I was able to follow and complete the week's homework, however I haven't solved the issue with hardcode credentinal on docker compose for postgres database. For homework challenges, I finished 6/8 challenges expect the challenges for running outside Gitpod and on EC2. For the challenges on multi-stage build and best pratice for docker file, there are a lot of space to improve, since my handons exprience is not enough.
